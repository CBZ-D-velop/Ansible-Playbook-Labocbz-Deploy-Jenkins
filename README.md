An Ansible playbook to deploy and configure a Jenkins server on your hosts.

This Ansible playbook orchestrates the installation of Jenkins, Docker, Apache2, and Jenkins agents. Notably, Jenkins lacks native SSL support, making the presence of an SSL reverse proxy highly recommended, although its installation is not mandatory in this playbook. Additionally, Apache2 installation is conditional based on a boolean variable.

If remote certificates are available, the playbook can download and install them for Apache2. Security measures, including mod evasive, mod qos, WAF, and optimization configurations, are also managed.

For Jenkins agents, a dedicated Ansible role is employed. This role simplifies the installation of Jenkins agents on host machines, handling file architecture for job execution and supporting CI workflows focused on Docker. It allows explicit user definition, start-up as a service, and the addition of security options such as basic authentication, CA certificates, etc. It's crucial to have Java installed, and Docker if needed for Docker-centric CI workflows.

In summary, this comprehensive Ansible playbook addresses the installation and configuration of Jenkins, Docker, Apache2, and Jenkins agents, providing flexibility and security measures tailored to specific deployment requirements.

## Deployment diagramm

![Ansible-Playbook-Labocbz-Deploy-Jenkins](./assets/Ansible-Playbook-Labocbz-Deploy-Jenkins.drawio.svg)

Here is a possible deployment example with this playbook. The components involved are Apache2, Jenkins, Docker, and Watchtower. We observe that clients access Jenkins through Apache2, which acts as an SSL/TLS proxy. An agent installed on the second host, communication are donne with SSL and TCP socket.

## Tests and simulations

### Basics

You have to run multiples tests. *tests with an # are mandatory*

```MARKDOWN
# syntax
# converge
# idempotence
# verify
side_effect
```

Executing theses test in this order is called a "scenario" and Molecule can handle them.

Molecule use Ansible and pre configured playbook to create containers, prepare them, converge (run the playbook) and verify its execution.
You can manage multiples scenario with multiples tests in order to get a 100% code coverage.

This playbook contains a ./tests folder. In this folder you can use the inventory or the tower folder to create a simualtion of a real inventory and a real AWX / Tower job execution.

### Command reminder

```SHELL
# Check your YAML syntax
yamllint -c ./.yamllint .

# Check your Ansible syntax and code security
ansible-lint --config=./.ansible-lint .

# Execute and test your playbook
molecule create
molecule list
molecule converge
molecule verify
molecule destroy

# Execute all previous task in one single command
molecule test
```

## Installation

To install this playbook, just copy/import this playbook or raw file into your fresh playbook repository or call it with the "include_playbook/import_playbook" module.

## Usage

### Vars

```YAML
# From inventory
---
# all vars from to put/from your inventory
# see tests/inventory/group_var for all groups and vars.
```

```YAML
# From AWX / Tower
---
all vars from to put/from AWX / Tower
```

## Architectural Decisions Records

Here you can put your change to keep a trace of your work and decisions.

### 2024-01-04: First Init

* First init of this playbook with the bootstrap_playbook playbook by Lord Robin Crombez

### 2024-01-05: Advance

* Playbook install Apache2, Docker, Jenkins
* Need to get the Jenkins password on log after isntall for first launch
* You can protect your Jenkins behind Apache2

### 2024-03-02: Fix and CI

* Added support for new CI base
* Edit all vars with __
* Tested and validated on Docker

### 2024-05-19: New CI

* Added Markdown lint to the CICD
* Rework all Docker images
* Change CICD vars convention
* New workers
* Removed all automation based on branch
